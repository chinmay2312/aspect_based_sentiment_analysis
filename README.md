Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis makes it easier to identify and determine the sentiment towards specific aspects in text. 
This project aims at analysing the corpus, understanding various approaches to tackle the task and finally building a classifier capable of determining the sentiment of this corpus. 
We examine various text cleaning techniques, machine learning models and discuss their respective merits.
